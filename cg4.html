    <p> The Common Ground website has been founded as a resource to bring all people together in order to help solve the homeless problem in New York City. Its aim to increase awareness surrounding homelsseness and to encourage people to become actively involved in working to solve this issue. Common Ground has also been created to provide those in need a place to find a variety or information and resources that are available to them. All resources and organizations referenced on the Common Ground site have been carefully selected. 
    </p>
    <p> In New York around 77,000 are homeless people,  New York City has the largest homeless population in the country. In the past half century the population of homeless people in New York City has unfortunately increased steadily. In the last decade alone the number of people spending the night in homeless shelters has increased by 43%. Tonight approximately 63,000 individuals will be sleeping in a homeless shelter, that leaves 10,000 individuals sleeping rough on the streets of New York City. It can be very challenging for many homeless individuals to find the shelter closest to them. We decided to create a system that allows individuals in need to input their location and find a shelter nearest to them. Common Ground  also provides individuals with information regarding specialty shelters that can  provide care for single women, children, disabeled people etc.
