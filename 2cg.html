          <p>Today, there are tens of thousands of men, women, and children living on the streets of New York City.  20-40% of these people are LGBTQ youth and unfortunately, this number only appears to be growing.  By donating your time, money, or resources you could be a part of ending this epidemic and helping someone to get back on their feet. Getting involved in your community through the act of donating goods, time or services not only helps those in need but can be a very rewarding, educational and fun experience for yourself. It has also been seen that volunteering can improve your health! Homelessness is a growing issue in New York City but if we have volunteers and people committed to being involved in preventative resources and aid to the homeless starting at early stages we can hopefully decrease the number of homeless individuals. Below is an article on all the great benefits of volunteering.</p><br>
